When any of these operations are run, the ${symbol_dollar}animate service
will examine any JavaScript-defined animations (which are defined by using the ${symbol_dollar}animateProvider provider object)
as well as any CSS-defined animations against the CSS classes present on the element once the DOM operation is run.</p>
